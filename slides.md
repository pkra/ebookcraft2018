# Equations â‰  Math

<img style="width: auto; max-width:95%; height: auto; max-height:30vh" width="658.01306" height="420.36343" src="./img/eqn-math-diagram.svg" alt="venn diagram: mathematics and equations with an intersection but neither encompassing the other">

???
* words are important
* math is not equations
* neither includes the other
* equations are layout but also beyond math
* I do mostly math, so title is fitting
* still most of this talk will be about equations
* equations are layout

???
* From linked data: There's no agreed upon data model for equations let alone math
* we have to start outside the web:
  * where do people author / what do vendors create
* TeX/LaTeX
  * history
  * strengths: canonical rendering, stable subsets (texvc, mathjax, jats4Reuse), made for human authoring, accessible for proficient users
  * weaknesses: TeX vs LaTeX, layout language, no semantics & not generally accessible, baroque syntax, print-focus, Chomsky Type 0, incompatible half-breeds for the web
* (Presentation) MathML
  * history
  * strengths: XML language, W3C and ISO standard
  * weaknesses: does not specify layout (only abstraction thereof), not supported by browser vendors, not made for humans, no semantics / Content MathML is  mess, not accessible
    * state of MathML Editors - a mess
    * vendors quality - a mess
* [reduce] OMML / unicodeMath
  * history, example code, https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/murrays/2006/10/06/mathml-and-ecma-math-omml/
  * strengths: part of Microsoft Office XML, canonical rendering, isomorphic XML and plain text format, can be converted to MathML
  * weaknesses: no semantics, limited to Office, poorly documented, licensing issues for tools
* [reduce] AsciiMath
  * history, example code
  * strengths: made for tiny humans, easy to convert to MathML or TeX, limited expressivity makes it somewhat accessible
  * weakness: limited expressivity, not well established, not standardized
* [reduce] programming language syntaxes
  * CAS (maple, mathematica), scientific computing (sciPy, R, Julia), general purpose languages (java)
    * example code, e.g. https://reference.wolfram.com/language/guide/MathematicalTypesetting.html
  * strengths: computational ability, perfectly semantic, made for programmers, easily converted to other formats
  * weaknesses: limited expressivity, only procedural / not conceptual, barebones syntax, not made for humans, not actually leveraged for anything (e.g., accessibility)

    e.g., WIRIS, MathMagic, MathQuill, MathLive, MathType, MathFlow, HostMath
    </details>
* <details>
    <summary>Built-in editors</summary>
    e.g., MS Word & LibreOffice, Maple & Mathematica & MathWorks
    </details>


???
* raw text (TeX etc)
* Specialist Editors (MathType, MathFlow, MathMagic, WIRIS, MathQuill, HostMath, MathLive)
  * almost all editors can produce more than one format
  * many have custom/proprietary internal format, often used for more functionality (e.g., accessibility features)
* Built-in editors (MS Word & LibreOffice, Maple & Mathematica & MathWorks)
  * like specialists but focused on integrating into their host apps

# Equations in XML workflows

* Really, use the Source, Luke!



???
* 10min
* MathML
  * why it  dominates
    * early editing tool adoption (e.g., MathType)
    * enough vendor traction
    * success in XML-to-print
    * eternal promise of the web
  * how is it integrated?
    * most formats integrate it directly (e.g. JATS/BITS)
    * in XML, many features are handled separately desipte features in MathML (e.g., mlabeldtr, annotation system)
    * binary image rendering history still plays big role
* LaTeX subsets
  * very common suggestion even in XML, e.g., MathJax in JATS4Reuse
  * fixed grammars are straight forward (e.g., texvc for MediaWiki)
  * main issue: general macro resolution is hard
    * still many vendors seem to have found decent proprietary solutions
* Use the Source!
  * keep sources whenever you can, it always adds value
* Common Problems and Challenges
  * QA problems
    * usually QA means print output
    * QA is always engine specific
      * leading to problems when using different engines (e.g., print and web)
  * rendering problems (e.g, wrong stretchy rules, confusion about unclear display style rules)
  * mathvariants vs (non-BMP) Unicode
    * Unicode math alphabets come out of print, dubious elsewhere
  * markup vs font engines
    * combining characters (e.g., accents)
    * in markup or via font/unicode renderin?
  * the equation label conundrum
    * document-level information (especially when auto-numbering)
    * where to keep them in an XML workflow
  * storing alternative formats
    * in XML (e.g. JATS <alternatives>) vs MathML <annotation>
    * source formats
      * e.g., LaTeX: store full documents or just (math mode?) snippet
    * alttext
    * altimages
  * integrating rendering information in XML workflows
    * SVG
    * HTML+CSS doesn't quite fit
  * limitations of both MathML and Unicode
    * mathcal
    * non-standard glyphs (Wiley Chem)
      * PUA-heavy fonts
      * TeX legacy (St Mary Road)
  * limitations of MathML
    * commutative diagrams, graphs etc
    * multi-equation alignment
    * entry points for XML/HTML

# MathML and today's web


* MathML is dead. Long live MathML!
* Similarities and differences to sucessful web technologies.
* Making more out of MathML on the web

???

* 10 min
* MathML is effectively dead
  * Math WG dead
  * browser development by volunteers only and dead
  * MathML is used on the web only in combination with JS rendering engine
    * at most as accessibility alternative, with non-MathML visual rendering
  * => standard frozen. Bad for everyone.
    * eternal hope for the web is preventing the XML success of MathML to move forward
* similarities and differences
  * same: xml-ish
  * meh: MathML is like HTML 3 not HTML 5
    * no semantics
    * layout in markup (table/font/blink)
  * diff: content in attributes, operator dictionary
* make more of it on the web!
  * MathML a good basis for rendering for the web
    * much like print: choose an engine and go
  * HTML+CSS, SVG, even canvas
  * but MathML still provides a good vehicle for creating web content
    * converters to HTML or SVG grow continuously and become simpler
  * additional information can be passed from MathML to web output due to structural similarities
    * see a11y below

* Future of accessible equation rendering
* Future of mathematical content

???

* future of MathML
  * Part ways; deprecate from the web
  * Save it for XML and print - extend, clarify, fix
  * learn from what happens on the web
* future of equation rendering
  * CSS (variable fonts, grid, container queries)
  * Houdini (maybe)
  * web components (maybe)
