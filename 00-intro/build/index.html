# Equations â‰  Math

<img style="width: auto; max-width:95%; height: auto; max-height:30vh" width="658.01306" height="420.36343" src="./img/eqn-math-diagram.svg" alt="venn diagram: mathematics and equations with an intersection but neither encompassing the other">

???
* words are important
* math is not equations
* neither includes the other
* equations are layout but also beyond math
* I do mostly math, so title is fitting
* still most of this talk will be about equations
* equations are layout

# MathJax

* [MathJax](https://www.mathjax.org)
* Open-Source JavaScript equation rendering solution
* Converts input into HTML+CSS and SVG, on client & server
* Continuously developed (and funded) since 2009
* 200+ million unique visitors to MathJax-enabled sites
* [most](https://libscore.com/#MathJax) [popular](https://w3techs.com/technologies/overview/javascript_library/all) equation rendering engine for the web
* growing number of projects inspired by MathJax

???

* I'll fall back a lot to MathJax
* there are alternatives
* but it's a useful first step
