 * working primarily with STEM publishers
 * primarily on web-oriented production workflows
 * ebooks got me into this mess ;-)

# Equations â‰  Math

<img style="width: auto; max-width:95%; height: auto; max-height:30vh" width="658.01306" height="420.36343" src="./img/eqn-math-diagram.svg" alt="venn diagram: mathematics and equations with an intersection but neither encompassing the other">

???
* words are important
* math is not equations
* neither includes the other
* equations are layout but also beyond math
* I do mostly math, so title is fitting
* still most of this talk will be about equations
* equations are layout

# MathML and today's web

* MathML is dead. Long live MathML!
* Similarities and differences to sucessful web technologies.
* Making more out of MathML on the web

???

* 10 min
* MathML is effectively dead
  * Math WG dead
  * browser development by volunteers only and dead
  * MathML is used on the web only in combination with JS rendering engine
    * at most as accessibility alternative, with non-MathML visual rendering
  * => standard frozen. Bad for everyone.
    * eternal hope for the web is preventing the XML success of MathML to move forward
* similarities and differences
  * same: xml-ish
  * meh: MathML is like HTML 3 not HTML 5
    * no semantics
    * layout in markup (table/font/blink)
  * diff: content in attributes, operator dictionary
* make more of it on the web!
  * MathML a good basis for rendering for the web
    * much like print: choose an engine and go
  * HTML+CSS, SVG, even canvas
  * but MathML still provides a good vehicle for creating web content
    * converters to HTML or SVG grow continuously and become simpler
  * additional information can be passed from MathML to web output due to structural similarities
    * see a11y below

# Rendering equations on the web


* Rendering tools for & of the web
      * MathML: <a href="https://www.mathjax.org">MathJax</a>, <a href="https://mathscribe.com/author/jqmath.html">jqmath</a>, <a href="http://www.fmath.info/mathml.jsp">fmath</a>
      * Other: <a href="http://mathquill.com/">MathQuill</a>, <a href="http://mathlive.io/">mathlive</a>, <a href="https://khan.github.io/KaTeX/">KaTeX</a>
      * Proprietary: <a href="http://wiris.com/">WIRIS</a>, <a href="http://sharemath.com/">ShareMath</a>
      * Generic workflows
* Client vs server-side

> I'd just as soon kiss a Printer!

???

* tools and techniques for rendering mathematics in a web context
* 15 min
* MathML rendering tools
  * MathJax, jqmath, fmath
* other rendering tools
  * MathQuill, mathlive, KaTeX
* proprietary solutions (WIRIS, sharemath, )
* client vs server-side
  * go server for performance
  * add client for enhancements
* a word on web-based print (Antenna House, Prince, Vivliostyle)

# Future(s) of math on the web


* Future of MathML
* Future of visual equation rendering
* Future of accessible equation rendering
* Future of mathematical content

???
* 10 min
* future of MathML
  * Part ways; deprecate from the web
  * Save it for XML and print - extend, clarify, fix
  * learn from what happens on the web
* future of equation rendering
  * CSS (variable fonts, grid, container queries)
  * Houdini (maybe)
  * web components (maybe)
* future of accessible rendering
  * ARIA all the things
  * AOM
